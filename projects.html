	<p>Several engineering initiatives have been launched to explore possible solutions to
		delivering on the promise of web3d and overcoming technical challenges to its success.</p>
	
	<h2><a href="https://cone.jondgoodwin.com/index.html">Cone Programming Language</a></h2>
	<p>Optimal performance and minimal code footprint are essential to a responsive 3D experience.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Client.</b> 
		3D worlds are punishing to deliver, as they have to perform millions of rendering and motion
		calculations reliably every 16 milliseconds. 
		<p>Internet bandwidth constraints magnify these challenges;
		if we cannot keep world assets and the underlying engine's code compact, it will be impossible
		to stream them from the server to the client on a timely basis. This will require the ability to 
		stream needed assets on a just-in-time basis and then re-hydrate the assets without disrupting
		real-time rendering.</p>
		<p>These characteristics are hard enough when delivering these experiences via native executables.
		How much worse, when delivering via a browser using WebGL and Wasm technologies.</p></li>
	<li><b>Server.</b> 
		3D world servers need to keep multiple player clients synchronized to the most recently re-calculated state of the world.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Cone programming language was designed and built as a foundation toolkit  
		for satisfying these 3D world requirements.
		Blazingly-fast, lagless runtime performance is key to its value proposition.
		Cone makes it much easier to leverage performance strategies, such as cache-friendly data architecture (including ECS),
		memory management (arena, pool, and borrowed references), and friendly actor-based concurrency.</p>

	<h2><a href="pegasus3d/index.html">Pegasus3D browser and Acorn programming language</a></h2>
	<p>This project explored the idea of encoding intelligent 3-d assets as programs written in the
		<a href="pegasus3d/acorn/index.html">Acorn programming language</a> (a dynamically-typed language loosely inspired by Lua).
		A working browser, called Pegasus3D, was built within the Acorn VM. 
		It included built-in classes that facilitated 3d rendering, user interactivity, and the ability to retrieve
		Acorn and image assets from the internet.</p>
