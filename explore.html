    <div class="text">
	  <p>One score and several quadrillion nanoseconds ago, our web-father brought forth upon this Internet, 
	  a new world-wide web, conceived in hypertext connectivity, and dedicated to the proposition that anyone 
	  may freely use or modify it. 
	  The simple web that Tim Berners-Lee wove in CERN&rsquo;s lab now stretches around the globe, 
	  encompassing billions of colorful, interactive, interconnected pages offered up by millions of independent sources.</p>
	  <p>But these pages, they are flat! 
	  Sometimes we want to immerse ourselves within three-dimensional virtual worlds, 
	  where we can explore, play, and make things happen in a way that feels like a more natural 
	  extension to the three dimensional world we inhabit than flipping through virtual pieces of paper. 
	  To make this possible, we must design and build an comparable Web3D eco-system of 
	  browsers, servers and standards, inspired and informed by existing world-wide web technologies.</p>
	  <p>Until a good working demonstration of Web3D has been created, 
	  we must use these inadequate words on a page to imagine how users would experience this 3-dimensional web.</p>
		
	  <h3>Scenes and Objects</h3>
		<p>The 3-D equivalent to a web page is a scene. 
		A scene might be a virtual house, a landscape, a neighborhood or city, a store or marketplace, 
		outer space, a game zone, a simulation, a living organism, and so much more. 
		Every scene defines the location of all static and animated objects within its boundaries, 
		as well as a view of the space that lies beyond its boundaries (such as the scene&rsquo;s terrain 
		or floor and its sky or bounding walls).</p>
		<p>A scene consists of various types of objects:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><span class="p-hdr">Static Scenery.</span>
			Static objects establish the scene&rsquo;s overall look and layout, 
			including the landscape, buildings, flora and fauna, furniture, skyscrape, 
			and any other decorations whose position and behavior never (or rarely) changes. 
			These objects might employ some animation (such as flowing, rippling water or the swaying branches of a tree). 
			Passive objects can be solid (obstacles to or pedestals for other objects) or 
			immersive (other objects can pass through them, but perhaps with some potential effect). 
			They may cast light or shadows, or distort views (like a smoky window or mirror). 
			They may exert a force on other objects (such as gravity).</li>
			<li><span class="p-hdr">Interactive agents.</span>
			These objects have more sophisticated, 
			scripted behavior that is triggered by or influences other scene objects. 
			Their animated motion may represent a current state (running, climbing, waving, bowing, fighting, etc.). 
			They may offer buttons or other controls that can be manipulated by users or other objects. 
			They might have wallpaper surfaces that display video streams, images, web pages and more. 
			They may have sensors which will trigger scripted behavior based on what they are near or what is happening around 
			or to them.
			<p>Truly amazing things are possible when the behavior of objects originates somewhere else on the 
			Internet or the real-world. Imagine a mailbox that fully connects to your e-mail service provider. 
			Imagine an accurate clock and calendar, synced to your time zone and appointments. 
			Imagine a phone connected to your Skype account, able to place and receive calls around the world. 
			Imagine a painting on your house&rsquo;s wall that can play movies from Netflix.</p></li>
			<li><span class="p-hdr">Avatars.</span>
			Each avatar in a scene represents a user that is currently visiting that scene. 
			Avatars are interactive agents whose behavior is directly controlled by the user it represents. 
			The look of each user&rsquo;s avatar represents an interesting challenge, as user&rsquo;s will 
			want the flexibility to choose what their avatar looks like (even to the point of using the same 
			avatar across every scene they might visit), but each scene&rsquo;s owner may want to 
			restrict the look of avatars for functional or community policy reasons. This issue is discussed 
			in greater depth below.</li>
			<li><span class="p-hdr">Portals.</span>
			These interactive objects (or specified regions at the outer boundary of the scene) 
			operate like hyperlinks, providing a way to transport a user to another other Web3D scene or 
			to another location within the current scene. The portal might be triggered by proximity 
			or by using its provided controls. Since portals represent a gateway to another scene, 
			it might render some perspective of the scene it references as part of its visual look, 
			typically with a lower level of detail.</li>
			<li><span class="p-hdr">Sound Sources.</span>
			A scene can include sounds as well as sights. A scene&rsquo;s sound source can be ambient to a 
			specific region within the scene, have a specific location in space, or be attached to a 
			specific user wherever they go. A sound source might be music, an audio clip, or 
			live audio streamed across the Internet.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Scene View and Navigation</h3>
		<p>At any point in time, the user views a scene from the perspective of an imaginary camera 
		which is positioned relative to the location and orientation of their avatar. 
		Generally this is a &nbsp;2-dimensional or stereoscopic projection of the scene. 
		Various windows, icons and text may be overlaid onto this view based on how the user interacts with the scene.</p>
		<p>Users navigate their avatar (and its accompanying camera view) through a scene 
		using standard controls. Such controls move the avatar forward, back, right, left, up or down, or 
		change the avatar&rsquo;s orientation. Some controls change the camera view that is loosely 
		tied to the avatar&rsquo;s position and orientation (such as scrolling the camera back 
		behind an avatar&rsquo;s &ldquo;eyes&rdquo;).</p>
		<p>Although many controls are standardized, the effect they have varies depending on the scene&rsquo;s movement rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Each scene defines its own physics rules for how objects move or collide. 
			Movement behavior will be vary noticeably between land, outer space and underwater scenes, 
			affected by gravity, friction, momentum, etc.</li>
			<li>Some scenes may choose to restrict or not support certain kinds of movement.</li>
			<li>The user&rsquo;s control devices will implement these standard controls in different ways. 
			A mouse/keyboard user will navigate differently from a touch screen or glasses user.</li>
			<li>Users may customize how their device&rsquo;s buttons are mapped to the standard navigation controls. 
			Some users may prefer to use the up arrow to move forward, and others may prefer to use the 
			&ldquo;w&rdquo; key.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The key idea here is that once a user learns how to navigate any specific 3D scene, 
		they already have a basic idea of how to navigate through any other 3D scene they might visit.</p>
		
		<h3>Scene Interaction and Manipulation</h3>
		<p>Although some scenes will be built primarily for passive consumption (like a book or a movie), 
		the greater value in other scenes comes from all the ways users can interact with the scene and 
		other users in that scene. A user can do so in various ways:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><span class="p-hdr">Targeted Object.</span>
			A user targets a specific object using consistent controls (such as touching or clicking it, 
			tab-cycling through interactive objects in-front of the user, etc.). 
			A &ldquo;use&rdquo; touch (e.g., left-click) triggers the default action for the object. 
			A &ldquo;query&rdquo; touch (e.g., right click) offers a window menu of actions the user can select between. &nbsp;</li>
			<li><span class="p-hdr">Object Controls.</span>
			Some objects may offer touch-sensitive controls on their surface. Each control governs 
			a different aspect of the object&rsquo;s behavior (for example, a music player might have different controls to play, 
			rewind, change playlist, etc.)</li>
			<li><span class="p-hdr">Broadcast Action.</span>
			A user may broadcast some action to all objects within a certain distance of their avatar, 
			such as saying something, issuing a challenge, or swinging a weapon.</li>
			<li><span class="p-hdr">Proximity.</span>
			Some objects trigger specific scripted behavior whenever another object or avatar&rsquo;s position 
			gets near it in a certain direction.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="c0"><span>The scene and the object&rsquo;s script determine how it will respond to any of these triggers. 
		The interaction may be ignored, may yield a change in the object&rsquo;s behavior (visual or auditory), 
		or the object may display a custom <b>window</b>&nbsp;on the user&rsquo;s screen either 
		to display additional information or to gather more information about what the user wants. 
		The user interacts with these windows similarly to any web page, with the final action 
		typically removing the window from the screen. 
		The user can sometimes customize the position and size of this window on their screen 
		for future interactions with similar objects. In many cases, the displayed window may actually 
		be a real web page sourced from another site.</p>
		<p>In some cases, users may wish to &ldquo;pin&rdquo; an object&rsquo;s window to their screen, 
		which enables them to continue to interact with an object even when they have moved far 
		from that object and are possibly in another completely unrelated scene. 
		This pinned window can be minimized to an small icon on the screen and opened up later as needed. 
		With this simple, but powerful mechanism, users can accumulate their most frequently used 
		resources with them (chat, phone, e-mail, clock, calendar, portal bookmarks, etc.) 
		and take them with them wherever they go. They can also use this mechanism to create <b>hotkeys</b> for 
		common objects actions appropriate to specific scenes or situations. 
		These icons can further be mapped to the user&rsquo;s device control, 
		such as keyboard keys, mouse buttons, etc.</p>
		<p>Some scenes may give authorized users the power to add or delete objects to the scene, 
		reposition or resize them, change their properties or behavioral scripts, and more. 
		Standard controls are defined for a basic core set of object manipulations.</p>
		
		<h3>Ownership Controls</h3>
		<p><sA world-wide 3-D web needs controls to keep users and content providers safe and profitable. 
		Fortunately, the same controls used by the Internet now will also well serve the 3-D web.</p>
		<p>Every scene is owned and operated by the server at that scene&rsquo;s domain name. 
		People entering that scene may be required to be pre-authorized to enter and 
		will typically be asked to abide that site&rsquo;s rules of behavior.</p>
		<p>Each web site that wants to limit access to their 3-d worlds can require users to register, 
		login and interact via encrypted communications.</p>
		<p>Similarly, 3-D web site owners can require users pay for access to all or some portion of their 
		content or services.</p>
		
		<h3>Avatars</h3>
		<p>In many cases, users enjoy being able to choose how they appear as an animated 3-D object 
		(or being) within any particular scene. However, specific scenes may have legitimate reasons 
		for wanting to restrict how those avatars might appear to other users within that scene. 
		A scene in outer space may want avatars to only be spaceships, thinking a pink unicorn 
		might be out of place. A virtual store may not want to allow nude people avatars.</p>
		<p>One mechanism for solving this conflict:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Users acquire, customize or create one or more avatars, each of whose rendering instructions 
			are actually stored as URL resources on the Internet, like any other 3-D object.</li>
			<li>Users can submit their avatars to any certifying authority who ensures it complies 
			with whatever appearance rules they have established.</li>
			<li>A user chooses which avatar they wish to &ldquo;play&rdquo; for any specific scene they are in 
			(typically, one of them is their default avatar for any new scene).</li>
			<li>Whenever a user enters a scene, the scene confirms that the user&rsquo;s chosen avatar 
			is listed by whatever certifying authority best enforces their rules. If the avatar conforms, 
			that avatar will be shown to other users in that scene. If not, the scene will pick another 
			acceptable avatar (which may be no avatar at all) to render that user to others in the scene 
			(although the user still has the right to see their own chosen avatar within that scene).</li>
		</ul>
