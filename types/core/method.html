		<p>A <b>method</b> is a stateless procedure which receives some values, does some work using those value,
		and returns one or more values. New methods are typically defined either by compiling an Acorn source program
		or from loading a shared library containing types defined using the C API.
		Use of a method most often happens within the context of using any value's active properties,
		although it is possible to invoke them directly as a function (having no defined self) using '()'.</p>
		
		<h3>Class Properties <i>(see Type)</i></h3>
		<dl>
		<dt>New</dt> 
		<dd>(pgmsrc, baseurl) -> method
		<p>Compile the program source (a Text value) and return the compiled method.
		A single program may include definitions of other methods which are also compiled
		each as its own method instance which is stored appropriately.</p>
		<p>baseurl is a symbol indicating the URL where the program source came from. 
		This provides needed context to resolve any relative url's specified within the program.
		baseurl may be null.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>_newtype</dt>
		<dd>-> mixin
		<p>The mixin whose properties are used by instances of Method.</p>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Instance Properties</h3>
		<dl>
		<dt>[]</dt> 
		<dd>[...] -> values
		<p>Perform the method with a self of null, passing all specified parameters to it.
		All return values from the method are returned.</p></dd>
		<dt>arity</dt> 
		<dd>-> integer
		<p>Return the number of fixed parameters expected by the method (not including self).</p></dd>
		<dt>Link</dt>
		<dd>->count
		<p>Attempt to resolve any externs (static resources). Return null if all resolved,
		or else a count of the number of externs still unresolved (typically due to resources not finished loading).</dd>
		<dt>varargs?</dt> 
		<dd>-> bool
		<p>True if method accepts an arbitrary number of additional arguments (after the fixed set).</p></dd>
