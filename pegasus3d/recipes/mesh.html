	<h2>Space</h2>
	<p>Let's introduce some fundamental spatial concepts.</p>
	
	<h3>Xyz coordinates</h3>
	<p>The <a href="types/xyz.html">Xyz</a> type creates a point (or vector) in three-dimensional space, 
	specifying its x, y, and z coordinates:</p>
	<img src="xyz.png" alt="" height="240" width="240" />
	<p>Positive coordinates for x go right, for y go up, and for z come towards you from the screen
	(essentially in the direction of the labels for each axis).
	Going the opposite direction uses negative coordinates.</p>
	<p>The Xyz type implements the arithmetic operators, allowing coordinates to be added,
	multiplied by a scalar number, etc.</p>
	
	<h3>Mesh</h3>
	<p>A <a href="types/mesh.html">mesh</a> is a geometric shape in space built using Xyz points
	that are connected with each other into triangles.</p>
	<img src="dolphin_mesh.png" alt="" height="195" width="317" />
	<p>All objects in your scene, including the terrain and sky,
	use a mesh to define their shape. The scene's earth uses a generated mesh for a sphere, segmented by
	longitude and latitude lines.</p>
	<p>Typically, 3-D artists use sophisticated 3-D modeling tools, such as Blender, Maya, or 3DS Studio,
	to create a mesh. 
	The resulting mesh file (typically not an Acorn program) can then be loaded as a resource.</p>
	
	<h3>Position, Rotation and Scaling</h3>
	<p>Every object in a scene can specify its position, rotation and scale with those properties:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>position</dt>
	<dd>This indicates the object's position relative to its owner's coordinates.
	So, if the earth is given a position of Xyz[40,0,0], then every point in its mesh
	has its Xyz position shifted to the right by 40.</dd>
	<dt>rotation</dt>
	<dd>This indicates the object's orientation in space, relative to its owner.
	The rotation is specified as pitch, yaw and roll, specified as radians 
	(where 2*pi is equivalent to 360 degrees):
	<img src="pitch.png" alt="" />
	<p>The positive direction for each rotation is determined by the right-hand rule:
	point the thumb of your right hand in the positive direction of an axis, and your 
	fingers will curl in the positive direction for that rotation.</p></dd>
	<dt>scale</dt>
	<dd>This indicates how much to magnify (or reduce) the object, relative to its owner.
	A scaling of Xyz[2.0, 2.0, 2.0) would double an object's size.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Let's say that you combined several objects together into a <a href="types/group.html">Group</a>.
	Changing the position, rotation or scale of the group would affect all objects in that group.</p>
	<p>As a fun exercise, trying adding more planets to the scene, experimenting with 
	various positions, rotations and scalings.</p>
