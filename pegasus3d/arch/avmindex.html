		<p>The Acorn Virtual Machine is the foundation for the 3D web browser,
		providing a virtual machine environment and a reference implementation of the Acorn language.
		It manages all data structures, with built-in memory allocation and
		dynamic, iterative garbage collection. 
		In addition to basic data primitives, such as floating point numbers, text and lists,
		it also provides support for procedural data structures, such as stacks, classes, functions and closures.
		It includes a compiler and interpreter for Acorn.
		It includes the core type library, and provides a C API for implementing
		other high-performance types.</p>
		
		<h2>Using the AcornVM library</h2>
		<p>The Acorn VM is a reentrant, thread-safe C library which can be embedded into a larger program,
		such as the Marco Web3D browser.
		It has no dependencies on other libraries.
		It runs successfully on 32-bit Windows and 64-bit Linux. 
		With few (if any) changes, it is likely to be portable to other machine architectures.
		Its Git repository has a README.md with instructions for how to compile
		and build the library.</p>
		<p>Any program using the library should be sure to include:</p>
<pre>
#include "avm.h"
</pre>
		<p>The program creates a new VM by calling:</p>
<pre>
	Value th = newVM();
</pre>
		<p>The thread value returned must be passed to any use of a
		<a href="avmcapi.html">C API</a> function.
		To add additional types, either modify the global Index directly or 
		load shared libraries and run their init function (which modify global).</p>
		<p>One can then load and call an Acorn program to run it.</p>
		<p>When done with the VM, it is closed as follows:</p>
<pre>
	vm_close(th);
</pre>

		
		<h2>Architecture Layers</h2>
		<p>The Acorn VM is built up in layers:</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Values</dt>
		<dd>A self-typed, fixed-sized structure for all possible values.
		Its size is the size of the address space (32 or 64 bits). 
		Using a trick inspired by Ruby, a value might be an in-place integer, floating point number,
		or a special value (null, false, or true). 
		Alternatively, it could be a pointer to a dynamically allocated block that describes
		the properties for more complex values (such as collections, methods, or threads).
		See the <a href="avmcapi.html">C API</a> or avm_value.h for more information.</dd>
		<dt>VM</dt>
		<dd>The virtual machine layer handles all memory management, 
		including automatic, incremental, generational garbage collection.
		It creates a clonable global variable areas.
		It creates a one or more threads to manage a specific execution and data state (or stack).
		Most of the Acorn VM code accepts a thread as the first parameter, 
		which provides access to any value within the virtual machine.</dt>
		<dt>Datatypes</dd>
		<dd>The datatypes implement the core logic for the VM's atomic data encodings
		that are stored within a value's allocated data block.
		Datatypes are not the same as Acorn types, but do provide the foundation for them.
		Manipulation of datatypes is done using functions rather than methods.</dd>
		<dt>C API</dt>
		<dd>The <a href="avmcapi.html">C API</a> enables Acorn types, methods, and global variables
		to be implemented using C language code.
		The API provides direct access to datatype and VM functionality.
		Implementing types in C rather than Acorn improves performance 
		and provide access to C-based libraries and operating environment services.</dd>
		<dt>Core Types</dd>
		<dd>This code implements Acorn's object-oriented core types	using the VM's C API.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h2>Acorn Compiler</h2>
		<p>The Acorn compiler is implemented within the Method's .new constructor.
		It compiles a program in several steps, each requiring only a single pass:</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Scanner</dt>
		<dd>Divides the Acorn source program into discrete tokens.
		This stage automatically converts line formatting (such as indentation) into appropriate tokens.</dd>
		<dt>Parser</dt>
		<dd>Using Acorn's <a href="../acorn/ebnf.html">syntax</a> and precedence rules,
		the LR parser translates every Method's scanned tokens into an 
		<a href="avmast.html">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST).
		The AST is an s-expression that encapsulates the semantic structure of the Method's procedural logic.</dd>
		<dt>Generator</dt>
		<dd>Converts every Method's AST into <a href="avmbytecode.html">bytecode</a>, 
		which is stored as part of the allocated data block pointed at by the method's value.
		Acorn's bytecode is similar to Lua's; 
		the biggest differences stem from Acorn's object-oriented nature.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Whenever Acorn runs a bytecode-implemented method, its execution is interpreted
		by the Acorn VM.</p>

		<h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
		<p>Responsive performance is critical to widespread eagerness to explore 3-D worlds.
		Visitors want their virtual worlds to unfold and interact in a smooth and responsive way.</p>
		<p>This is not easy to accomplish with large, complex worlds whose large polygon and texture
		resources must be retrieved from the other side of the Internet.
		Dynamic, object-oriented, interpreted languages are not known for their blazing speed.
		So, performance is automatically handicapped when using Acorn to build Internet-hosted 3-d worlds.
		No wonder most world-class games are built using C/C++ and are pre-downloaded before use.</p>
		<p>Acorn's architecture substantially mitigates this handicap:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Where possible, performance-critical logic is implemented close to the silicon, making the Acorn
		code mostly a thin veneer of event-managing oversight controlling the work of skilled, high performance workers.
		<ul>
		<li>Acorn uses C-coded OpenGL and physics libraries, along with any dedicated graphics processor, 
		to handle the repetitive, demanding work of rendering 3-D scenes and handling object 
		motion and collision..</li>
		<li>The methods for Acorn's core and 3D types are written in C using Acorn's C API.</li>
		<li>Acorn code is pre-compiled into a simple bytecode, which the lightweight C-based interpreter can execute quickly.
		In the future, this can be further optimized using a tracing, just-in-time interpreter.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Acorn supports asynchronous and predictive resource loading to reduce start up delays.
		Additionally, the set-up of less important parts can be delegated to a background thread,
		so they appear as they become available for use.</li>
		<li>Acorn supports native multi-threading and incremental garbage collection 
		to reduce the likelihood of "lag spikes".</li>
		<li>Most of a world's Acorn code initializes the world and its parts, and is only performed once.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That said, this is a reference architecture for Acorn, 
		a way to demonstrate the viability of the web 3D concept.
		Additional performance enhancements can be straightforwardly accomplished.
		For example, the bytecode interpreter could be replaced with a tracing, just-in-time compiler.
		
		<h2>Legacy</h2>
		<p>The architecture for Acorn VM is inspired by Lua's VM architecture, inheriting its:
		<ul>
		<li><b>Simplicity.</b>
		Using a relatively simple, but comprehensive architecture
		helps speed the creation of a reference implementation for Acorn.</li>
		<li><b>Lightweight impact.</b>
		It is portable and minimizes storage requirements on host computers, particularly mobile devices.</li>
		<li><b>Performance.</b>
		It offers decent performance for both C-implemented type libraries and bytecode-compiled Acorn code.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Acorn's datatypes purify Lua's clever hybrids: 
		integers are distinct from floating point numbers, immutable symbols are distinct from mutable strings,
		and ordered arrays, associated tables, and types emerge from Lua's tables and meta-tables.</p>
