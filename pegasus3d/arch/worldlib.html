		<p>The <a href="../types/world/index.html">World Type Library</a>
		provides all the basic types needed to build a 
		renderable 3-D world able to handle incoming user input and timing events. 
		These type's properties and methods are implemented using the Acorn VM's C API.
		The methods handle all of the underlying calls needed to OpenGL and SDL
		needed to render a scene's 3-D and 2-D parts.
		They also intercept all user input and timing events and dispatch them
		out to subscribing parts.</p>
		<p>The World Type Library is compiled as part of the browser.</p>
