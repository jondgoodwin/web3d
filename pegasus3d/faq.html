	<p><b>What is the 3D web?</b></p>
	<p>When you click on the URL for a 3D world in your browser, the browser renders it in 3-dimensions 
	(typical web pages are very flat). 
	The experience is much like playing a 3D videogame: the camera moves with the character you play, 
	re-rendering the scene with full perspective and lighting 60x a second. 
	You can interact with the world in real-time, either as a single user or interacting with other visitors to that world.
	A much more immersive experience become possible when using a virtual reality (VR) headset.</p>

	<p><b>How is this different than PC gaming?</b></p>
	<p>With PC games you have to wait for the game to fully download to your PC before you can start experiencing it.
	Web-based distribution offers a more timely and convenient click-and-play experience.
	It also unlocks 3D content from proprietary distribution channels (e.g., Steam), 
	so you can freely access 3d content located on any Internet server anywhere in the world.
	You benefit from open, timely, world-wide access to 3D content, much like what you enjoy today with web pages.
	
	<p><b>No way! Games are BIG. Won't you still wait hours before you can play?</b></p>
	<p>No. 
	When you click on a world's URL, the browser retrieves only the 3D content needed at start up.
	While interacting with this start-up subset (e.g., perhaps selecting and customizing an avatar),
	additional content packages are automatically streamed from the server to your browser in the background, 
	in the order of when you need them.
	Handled properly, the content will be staged and sequenced to stay ahead of the your experience as much as possible.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, by taking advantage of procedural generation techniques,
	the size of 3D content can be reduced significantly, thereby speeding its transmission over the Internet.
	Instead of multi-megabyte models and textures, these assets can be reduced to re-sculpting instructions
	that refine low-fidelity assets into realistic scenes. 
	For example, Catmull-Clark subdivision usefully transforms simple geometric shape into a complex model with smooth curves. 
	Other techniques, such as extrusion, lathes, and random noise generators, offer similar promise.</p>
	
	<p><b>So the 3D Web is just for games?</b></p>
	<p>No.
	As 3D content becomes progressively easier and less expensive to create, its use will rapidly diversify.
	Imagine the possibilities: architectural and landscape designs, medical imagery, 
	virtual museums, real and imaginary time and place travel adventures, static and animated 3D art and entertainment,
	online shopping with more realistic, customizeable products viewable from all angles,
	virtual communities, online training and education, etc.</p>
	
	<p><b>Hasn't this been done already?</b></p>
	<p>Yes. It has been attempted several times before:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML)</a> (1994).
	It never took off. Static, low-fi content is 
	<a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=vrml+examples&tbm=isch">not very attractive</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3D">X3D</a> (2004).
	It never took off, though it featured better integration with HTML, Javascript, and eventually WebGL.
	It still <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/">lacks pizzazz</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> (2006).
	This thin layer to OpenGL has been more successful.
	It looks much better: consider this 
	<a href="http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/">water simulation</a> or this
	<a href="http://reath.free.fr/HDR/test.html">train island</a> (warning, it takes forever to load!).
	WebGL is solid, but accessing it via Javascript is not, due to performance and language deficiencies.
	Using Javascript to create engaging worlds featuring rich landscapes and complex interactions 
	between many parts and multiple users is hard to accomplish. 
	A scan of <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome?tag=WebGL">WebGL/JS showcase sites</a> 
	shows how limited their offerings still are, ten years later.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> (2016).
	WebAssembly does more than free the Internet from Javascript,
	it offers the promise of a high-performance execution platform for 3D.
	Working in harmony with WebGL, we can hopefully do much better than this
	<a href="http://webassembly.org/demo/">Unity game ported to WebAssembly</a>.
	This technology is still too new for us to know for sure.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>So, the 3D Web is just WebAssembly and WebGL?</b></p>
	<p>No. Those low-level technologies are not enough.
	We need a language that makes it easy to snap together 3D objects like Lego pieces to build worlds.
	When building websites, we use HTML (content) and Javascript (behavior).
	Similarly, 3D worlds are built using the <b>Cone</b> programming language, 
	which marries 3D content and behavior together in a single language.</p>
	<p>Cone is a static, compiled language that offers a performance profile competitive with C and C++.
	However, its rich, modular content-handling features,
	procedural generation capability, and native Unicode and URL/resource support
	make Cone much better suited for 3D.
	Specifying static content is like filling out an outline. 
	World parts are modular URL resources, snapped together like toy bricks. 
	Complex behaviors can be facilitated in simple ways using various built-in rules engines.</p>
	<p>Cone also offers many other improvements over C/C++: compile-time safety, 
	built-in high-level language constructs (concurrency, interfaces, sum types, closures, managed iterators, 
	slices, pattern matching, multiple return values, etc.) 
	and syntax conveniences (control clauses, 'this' operators, operator overloading, implicit return, parallel assignment, offside rule, etc.).
	<p>3D worlds are built using Cone programs and other assets. 
	The Cone programs are compiled to WebAssembly's binary format and stored with other assets on the world's server,
	ready to be rendered using any popular browser.</p>
	
	<p><b>Where does Pegasus3D fit in?</b></p>
	<p>In addition to Cone, we also need a rich library of factories for creating world parts.
	Much as Cone provides a convenient high-level layer for WebAssembly,
	Pegasus is a high-level layer that enriches use of WebGL, input and network devices.
	Think of this as the Document Object Model (DOM) for 3D worlds.
	Pegasus offers built-in support for features typically found in 3D engines: 
	motion and collision physics, physically-based rendering (realistic lighting), 
	skeletal animation, event triggers and storyboards, HUDs and user input handling, 
	networking support for multiple visitors to the same world, and so on.</p>
	
	<p><b>Can't I just use existing tools like Unity, Unreal or Godot instead?</b></p>
	<p>Of course, once they make it easy to port 3D content to WebAssembly.
	There are many advantages for using these tools, as demonstrated by the quality of the games
	they have built.
	If you have an itch to build a top-selling AAA game, go invest heavily in a professional game engine and staff. 
	Pegasus3d is not for you.</p>
	<p>The challenge is these tools were built for a dedicated gaming platform, 
	where assets and the engine are huge, local and insular.
	Their architecture is not so well suited to the performance and size constraints of web delivery,
	leading to long load times, and greater inconvenience supporting
	procedural generation and staged, background streaming of content.
	Furthermore, these engines do not support hyperlinked portals between worlds
	nor modular, cross-domain hyperlinks to sharable content, as you would expect from
	the open-access Internet.</p>
	<p>In addition, Cone and Pegasus are free and open-source.
	So, if you have a limited budget and some grit and ingenuity, 
	Pegasus3d offers a great way to home-brew and distribute not only your own game, 
	but many other kinds of immersive, interactive, engaging worlds.</p>
