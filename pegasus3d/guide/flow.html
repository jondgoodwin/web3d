		<p>Methods and functions package reusable instructions. 
		So far, our examples have only used assignment and expression-based instructions.
		Limited to this, our worlds would basically behave the same way over and over again.
		What we want is to be able to change part behavior as the world's conditions change.</p>
		<p>To accomplish this, our expression capabilities must be expanded to be able to 
		evaluate the state of the world. Then we need control flow instructions
		that change how a method or function performs its instructions based on an evaluation.</p>
		<p>Let's dive in!</p>
		
		<h2>Evaluating Values</h2>
		<p>How do we evaluate values against specific criteria?
		Broadly speaking, Acorn offers several tools:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Equivalence operators</b>: are two values the same?</li>
		<li><b>Comparison operators</b>: is one value greater than another?</li>
		<li><b>Pattern matching operators</b>: does one value match a specific pattern?</li>
		<li><b>Evaluation methods</b>: does a value comply with a type-specific criteria?</li>
		<li><b>Boolean operators</b>: can we apply multiple criteria against multiple values?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: Evaluation operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators, but higher than assignment.</p>

		<h3>Equivalence Operators</h3>
		<p>Equivalence operators are useful when you want to check whether a particular value has the same content
		and type as another value. Some examples:</p>
<pre>
x == 3.0        # Returns true if the local variable x's value is 3.0
x+1 != y        # Returns true if x is not exactly 1 greater than y
2 == 2.0        # Returns false, because the Integer vs. Float types do not match
true != false   # Returns true
</pre>
		<p>Equivalence checking is not always straightforward, depending on the value's type.
		Since floating point calculations are imprecise and can introduce "rounding errors", 
		two Float values will be declared "equal" if they are sufficiently close.
		Large, complex value types, such as lists, can take time comparing, as it requires
		comparing every element in the list for equivalence.</p>
		<p>In some cases, you may prefer the '===' operator to quickly know if two values are exactly the same.
		Two floats would have to match exactly, with no margin for calculation error. 
		Two List or Text values would have to point to the same List or Text value, 
		as a copy made of a list would not be exactly equal using the '===' operator.</p>

		<h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
		<p>Comparison operators are useful when you want to see if a value is greater
		or less than some other value. You can only check greater and less for value types that
		are <a href="types/comparable.html">Comparable</a>, which Integer and Float numbers are.</p>
<pre>
x >= 2          # Returns true if x is greater than or equal to 2 (>, <, <= are variants)
2 <= 2.0        # Returns false any time the types do not agree
</pre>
		<p>Float values are compared using the same closeness criteria described above.
		For one Float value to be less than another, it must be less by at least the comparable closeness.</p>
		<p>The '<=>' operator is another way to compare two values, returning
		an Integer rather than true or false: -1 if less, 0 if equal, and 1 if greater. 
		"Comparable" types use this rocket-ship operator/method to facilitate 
		comparing and sorting.</p>
<pre>
-2 <=> 4      # Returns -1
</pre>
		<p>A fun example:</p>
<pre>
frosty +[
	'<=>' other:>
		1  # frosty is always the greatest!

frosty>Float::Infinity  # true
</pre>

		<h3>Pattern Matching Operators</h3>
		<p>Sometimes we want to see if a specific value matches a particular pattern.
		Later on we will introduce several types of patterns, such as Range, regular expressions, 
		and even custom-built pattern types. In all cases, the way to do the match is the same:</p>
<pre>
5 =~ 1..7   # Returns true, since 5 is within the range between 1 and 7
1 !~ 5..6   # Returns true, since it fails the pattern match
</pre>
		<p>Patterns will always return false if the match fails. Some will return true, 
		but others, such as regular expressions, may return details about what it found during the match.
		This will be discussed later, when patterns are introduced.</p>
		<p>The pattern match operator is the only one that uses the right hand value (the pattern)
		to send the '=~' method to, with the left hard value as a parameter. 
		This exception makes the code easier to read, but puts the work on the pattern, where it belongs.</p>
		<p>If the pattern value's type does not support the =~ method, the == method is used.</p>

		<h3>Evaluation Methods</h3>
		<p>Since operators do not handle all the ways we may want to evaluate values,
		we use type-specific evaluation methods to all other criteria. For example:</p>
<pre>
x.null?       # Returns true if x's value is null, false otherwise
list.empty?   # Returns true if list has no members, false otherwise
</pre>
		<p>By convention, methods that return a true/false value have a '?' mark at the end,
		which improves code readability.</p>
	
		<h3>true or false?</h3>
		<p>How does Acorn evaluate whether a value is true or false?
		A value is considered false if it is either <span class="pre">false</span> or <span class="pre">null</span>. 
		All other values of any type, including
		<span class="pre">true</span>, <span class="pre">0</span> and <span class="pre">""</span> will
		be considered true.</p>

		<h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
		<p>What if you need to make a complex decision involving multiple values and criteria?
		This is where boolean expressions are useful. These use the logical operators
		and (&&), or (||) and not (!)
		to corral several evaluations together to arrive at a summary true/false decision:</p>
<pre>
0==3 || !2<3 && 3==3   # Returns true (&& is evaluated before ||)
</pre>
		<p>The logical operators work mostly how you would expect:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>As mentioned earlier, they can take in values that are not true or false.
		null and false will be considered false. All other values are considered true.</li>
		<li>The logical operators have a lower precedence than evaluation operators, but higher than assignment.
		! has the highest precedence, then &&, then ||. </li>
		<li>The boolean operators && and || will stop evaluating as soon as the answer is known for sure.
		This can be useful in situations where we want to allow several attempts to obtain a value.</li>
		<li>Although ! only return a value of either true or false, || and && return the
		final value checked (which could be a non-Bool value).</li>
		</ul>
<pre>
val1 = null
val2 = 4.5
val = val1 || val2    # Returns 4.5
</pre>

		<p><b>Note:</b> 
		In case it is not obvious by now, the logical control operators are not the same
		as the boolean arithmetic operators in other languages that do bit
		manipulations on Integer values. There should not be much need for them in Acorn,
		but they are provided as Integer methods (.not, .and, .or, .xor, .shl, .shr) if they are needed.</p>

		<h2>Control Flow Commands</h2>
		<p>Having evaluated values against criteria, 
		these Acorn tools can be used to control what happens next:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>? operator: to select one of two values</li>
		<li>if/switch/match commands: to determine which instructions to performed</li>
		<li>while command: to repetitively perform instructions as many times as needed</li>
		<li>for command: to perform instructions on each member of collection</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As with expressions, these all return a value (or null if nothing was done).</p>
		
		<h3>? operator: What Value Is Behind Door #2?</h3>
		<p>The ? operator is a concise way to pick one of two values within an expression.
		If the expression before the ? operator is true, the first value after is picked.
		Otherwise the value after the comma is chosen:</p>
<pre>
x = val<5.0 ? 5.0, val   # sets x to the higher between 5.0 and val
</pre>
		<p>Note: To avoid possible ambiguity, be sure there is a space before the ? operator.</p>

		<h3>if/switch/match commands: A Fork In The Road</h3>
		<p>There are several structures for specifying which instructions to perform.</p>
		
		<p><b>if/unless suffix</b>
		If you have a single instruction that should execute (or not) based on a condition, 
		append the instruction with 'if' or 'unless' followed by the condition:
<pre>
val = 5.0 if val<5.0   # if val is less than 5, set it to 5
velocity *= 1.1 unless stop_flag  # unless is the opposite of if
</pre>
		
		<p><b>if command</b> If you have several instructions perform or not, use the if command.
		The instructions to be performed should be tab-indented as a instruction block.</p>
<pre>
if cmd=='snow'
	sky::weather = cmd
	$.ambient Color::Gray
</pre>
		<p>If you want one set of instructions to run if the condition is true and another otherwise,
		add an else command and corresponding instruction block.</p>
<pre>
if actor::mood == 'happy'
	actor::action = 'dance'
else
	actor::eyes = 'cry'
</pre>
		<p>Use the elif command in between the if and else, should you need to check additional condition
		and perform the corresponding instructions. An 'if' structure can have arbitrarily many 'elif' sections
		as needed.</p>
<pre>
moving = true
if x<0.0
	speed = 0.0
	moving = false
elif y<3.0
	speed = 1.0
else
	speed = 5.0
</pre>
		<p><b>switch and match commands</b>
		These commands are a more concise alternative to if elif commands where we want to evaluate
		the same single value against multiple possibilities. The switch and match commands are identical,
		except that switch uses the '==' equivalence operator to compare and match uses the '=~' match operator.
		</p>
<pre>
match term_speed
0.0..1.5:
	ship.state = 'landing'
1.5..4.0:
	ship_state = 'crashing'
else
	ship_state = 'flattened'
</pre>

		<h3>while command: Play it Again, Sam!</h3>
		<p>The while command is used when we want to execute the same tab-indented block of instructions
		over and over again. A condition is provided, so that we can stop the repetition 
		whenever the condition fails. The condition is checked right away and every time after the
		block of instructions has been performed.</p>
<pre>
x = 0
while x<=5
	$env.log "WARNING, WARNING! Will Robinson"
	x+=1
</pre>
		<p>The <b>break</b> statement can be placed anywhere within the while instruction block 
		to offer another way to stop performing the instructions.</p>
<pre>
while true    # without the break, this loop would run forever
	actor.walkstep  # will happen at least once
	break 'rest' if keypress=='space' # returns the 'rest' value whenever the space bar is pressed
</pre>

		<h3 id="iterator">Collection Iterators</h3>
		<p>Sometimes we have a collection where we want to iterate through each and every element
		in the collection, performing some operation on that element.
		The for structure is one way to accomplish this. 
		(Another technique is the .each method, as described in the List chapter).</p>
		<p>The for statement lists a local variable to hold the element after 'for' and the 
		value of the collection after 'in'. The tab-indented instructions follow. 
		The break statement may also be used here, if required.</p>
<pre>
for x in msg_queue
	switch x
		'exit':
			break
		'key':
			.dokey
		
</pre>
		<p>As an alternative to the for command, there are several collection methods able 
		to iterate through the members of a collection, and perform a passed function on each one.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
list.each txt->   # For every item in the list, this function is called
	$env.log x    # ... logging the item in the log file
</pre>
