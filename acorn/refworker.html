	<p>Methods are always run within the context of an execution context.
	The context holds its execution state: the call and data stack that holds 
	all local variables for the still-running methods performed within that context.</p>
	<p>There are three types of execution context: Process, Thread and Yield.
	This chapter shows how to use and manage asynchronous processes and threads.
	The synchronous Yieldr was discussed earlier in the 
	<a href="refmethod.html#yielder">Method Definition</a> chapter.</p>
	
	<h2>Process</h2>
	<p>When Acorn is started, it automatically creates the main process and global variable context,
	as well as setting up the display window and gaining access to input events.
	The requested program (typically, a 3-D world) is automatically loaded into the global variable '$' 
	and run within the main process.</p>
	<p>The world assigns '$$' to be the current scene to render within the window. 
	Input events are automatically queued. The world's main loop retrieves the queued events 
	and dispatches them to the appropriate method for processing.</p>
	<p>At some point, the running world may want to transfer control to a new world
	(perhaps because the user has tripped a portal mechanism). 
	The simplest way to do this is:</p>
<pre>
$ = +Process('newworld.com')
</pre>
	<p>This launches a second process with its own pristine global variable context.
	It triggers the load and running of the program for a new world. While it is initializing, 
	both processes are running concurrently, with the old world's process continuing to 
	render the screen and process input events.</p>
	<p>Assigning '$' to the new World makes it the new main process.
	Control over the display and input devices is transferred to the new Process.
	The old main process is shut down.</p>
	<p>An alternative form is:</p>
<pre>
+Process.window('newworld.com')
</pre>
	<p>Instead of replacing the old world with a new one within the same window, 
	it launches a new window for the new world, leaving the old world (and its window) in place.</p>
	<p>In summary: Processes run independently and simultaneously.
	Each has its own global variable context. 
	Each is responsible for its own window rendering and input event handling.
	No facilities are provided for inter-process communications.
	Every 3-D world runs in its own Process.</p>
	
	<h2>Thread</h2>
	<p>Any process may launch asynchronous threads. 
	The thread belongs to the process it is launched within.
	Although a thread may not render the screen or handle input events,
	it shares access to all values within the process, including its global variable space.</p>
	<p>Unlike Yielders, threads execute simultaneously with each other and their owning process.
	Thus, threads are valuable for performing some task that will take a while to complete, 
	but whose answer is not needed immediately, such as resource loading and background calculations.
	Threads are not needed for input device events, as these are already captured asynchronously 
	and queued for processing by the main process.</p>
	<p>Use of threads offers significant advantages and disadvantages.
	Properly designed, threads can take advantage of multi-core devices and keep things moving during resource delays,
	thereby improving performance and reducing lag. 
	However, their use does carry penalties: they consume some performance bandwidth and 
	need special care to ensure simultaneously-running threads do not collide when altering shared data.</p>

	<p>This example asynchronously loads two resources into a part:</p>
<pre>
frosty = +Avatar
	name: 'Frosty'
	# '^' loads each resource in its own asynchronous thread
	^ model: @"../models/frosty.acn"
	^ skin: @"../materials/snowmatl.acn/"
	fire_resist:   0
	cold_resist: 100
</pre>
	<p>Frosty's 3-D model and skin are both defined in separate resources.
	It significantly improves the time it takes to initialize Frosty to have these resources loaded simultaneously.</p>
	<p>A lot happens under the covers of the simple '^' asynchronous operator.
	The expression that follows is treated as the code for a new Method.
	A new asynchronous thread is created to perform that Method, passing it
	any shared values referenced by the code (for this example, that would be 'this'
	which points to frosty). The thread starts immediately, effectively 
	loading the named resource and storing the result in the named member of 'this'.
	From the point of view of the caller, frosty's model and skin properties
	get magically populated at some point in the future.</p>
	
	<p>If the work to be made asynchronous does not fit concisely in a single expression,
	the block form of 'async' can be used:</p>
<pre>
primes = +List
# asynchronously create a list of all primes between 2 and 1000
async
	each x in 2 .. 1000
		sq = x.sqrt
		isprime = true
		each y in primes
			break if y&gt;sq || (isprime=(x%y!=0))
		primes &lt;&lt; y if isprime
</pre>
	<p>In this example, 'async' (synonym for '^') is followed by a block of code
	rather than a single expression. Despite that difference, it is handled in the same way:
	the block of code becomes the new method that a new asynchronous thread runs independently.</p>
	
	<h2>Every Context is a Value</h2>
	<p>Every created context is a value. 
	<span class="pre">+Process</span> returns the value for a created process.
	<span class="pre">async</span> (or '^') is an operator that returns the value of a spawned thread.</p>
	<p>As with all values, the context value can be stored, passed around and had methods performed on it.
	For example, the <span class="pre">.status</span> can be used to retrieve the status of 
	an execution context ('active', 'ready', 'done').</p>
	<p>The reserved word <span class="pre">context</span> is the value of the 
	currently running execution context. Using various context methods, one can navigate to pretty much any
	value in the Acorn virtual machine from 'context'.</p>
	
	<h2 id="wait">Wait: Suspending Threads</h2>
	<p>There are many situations where we want to suspend the operation of a thread.
	This should never be accomplished using a while loop that waits on a conditional expression to turn true.
	This can slow down the computer significantly and increase the likelihood of a runaway thread that freezes the 3-D world.
	</p>
	<p>The proper way to suspend a thread is by using one of Acorn's built-in '.wait' methods.
	These take advantage of safe, efficient hardware and operating facilities for suspending a thread, 
	then restarting it automatically when a pre-established condition is met.
	These are described in the following sections.</p>
	
	<h3>Synchronizing with other threads</h3>
	<p>To suspend the current thread until another thread has finished,
	using .wait on the value for that context:</p>
<pre>
other_context.wait
</pre>
	<p>A very common scenario is to kick off several asynchronous threads, then wait until they are all finished.
	Use a wait block to accomplish this:</p>
<pre>
wait
	^ Avator = @'types/avator.acn'
	^ AI = @'types/ai.acn'
	^ NPC = @'types/npc.acn'
</pre>
	<p>A World will typically use this technique to ensure that all its custom types have been loaded
	and are ready for use (other languages use 'require' for a similar purpose). 
	Similarly, parts can use this technique to ensure all its critical properties have been
	loaded and initialized.</p>

	<h3>Timer delays</h3>
	<p>The Timer .wait puts the current thread to sleep for at least the specified number of seconds.
<pre>
Timer.wait(0.5)  # pause for half a second. Equivalent to 500 milliseconds.
</pre>
	<p>If an Integer is used instead of a Float, the delay time is measured in milliseconds.</p>

	<h3>Waiting for Input Events</h3>
	<p>If the Input queue is empty, it can be efficient to suspend the main process until a new
	input event arrives. A time-out should always be specified (but one no bigger than the desired frame rate).
<pre>
Input.wait(0.033)
</pre>
	<p>This is performed automatically by World, while it handles input event dispatching.</p>

	<h3>Locking for Transactional Integrity</h3>
	<p>Since asynchronous threads cannot use a yield handshake to communicate with each other,
	they must coordinate activities through their access to shared collection values.
	However, this creates risk. 
	The biggest peril of simultaneous contexts happens when two contexts try to change the same
	values at the same time, stepping on each other and making a royal mess in the process.
	Such problems are hard to diagnose, as they happen unpredictably, sometimes with unexplained crashes,
	and sometimes with strange effects apparent long after the damage was done.</p>
	<p>A common way to avoid this is to place locks around code that manipulates a shared value.
	Acorn already does this within the core type methods, making them indivisibly atomic.
	A thread will automatically be suspended from changing a value while it is being changed by another thread.</p>
	<p>Placing additional locks is straightforward: First, create a Lock that is shared between threads. 
	Then use it to lock every section of code that might collide with each other over the same value,
	so that only one thread can use any of them at one time:</p>
<pre>
# Create a lock
alock = +Lock
# ...
# Lock a critical section
do alock
	list(2), list(4) = list(4), list(2)
</pre>
	<p>A 'do' block performs <span class="pre">alock.begin</span> at the start 
	and <span class="pre">alock.end</span> at the end of the block.</p>

	<h3>Monitoring a Condition</h3>
	<p>There are times it is valuable for a thread to go to sleep for a while
	until it gets a signal from another thread to wake up (some condition has been met).
	A Monitor is used for this.</p>
<pre>
alock = +Lock
mon = +Monitor
# ...
async
	# Wait for signal
	alock.lock
	mon.wait(0.5) # Time-out if not received signal in half a second
	alock.unlock

# Perform monitor kiss to wake up Sleeping Beauty
alock.lock
mon.signal
alock.unlock
</pre>
