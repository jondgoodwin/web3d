    <div class="text">
		<p>The reluctant creation of Acorn was triggered by need and frustration.</p>
		<p>The driving <b>need</b> is to gather and plant seeds that will grow into the three dimensional web,
		an open virtual universe where, with a click or a touch, one can explore millions of worlds (rather than pages).
		This is not a new dream, but prior attempts have failed to attain wide-spread adoption and use.</p>
		<p>The latest approach, giving Javascript access to OpenGL, is by far the best, giving rise
		to two intriguing libraries: 
		<a href="threejs.org" target="_">three.js</a> and 
		<a href="babylonjs.com" target="_">babylon.js</a>.
		WebGL notably improves on prior attempts in two key ways.
		First, all 3-D content and behavior are managed using just one language (Javascript).
		Second, it leverages the http/url protocol, 
		so that 3-D content can be retrieved from any Internet server.
		<p>For a taste of WebGL, admire the lovely artistry 
		of this <a href="http://reath.free.fr/HDR/test.html" target="_train">train island</a>
		or this <a href="http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/" target="_water">water simulation</a>!
		Then ponder: How long did it take to load the train scene?  
		Why could you not do anything on this island except watch the train go around the track?
		The sad truth is this: if you browse through the threejs and babylonjs showcases, 
		you will likely find most scenes uninspiring.
		Very few draw you in for long, often due to start-up delays, lackluster visuals, limited interactivity,
		and no social interaction.</p>
		<p>A language manual is not the place to explore everything necessary to succeed at the 3-D web.
		However, one thing is certain: today's technology is capable of much better than this.
		One need only look at the latest video games to realize this.</p>
		<p>The 3-D web needs a browser and underlying programming language that:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Simplifies the work of building appealing and engaging 3-D worlds</li>
		<li>Delivers a responsive experience, both at start up and while exploring.</li>
		<li>Uses and facilitates free and open standards and components</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The <b>frustration</b> is that no existing programming language is well suited for this task.
		The 3-D web could be built far more quickly if we could plug in
		an available and widely supported programming language.
		Alas, existing languages were built to serve other purposes.
		Using Javascript to deliver 3-D worlds is like using a wrench to pound nails.
		You can do it, but you might not enjoy the experience.
		It is not that Javascript is missing one or more major features. 
		It is just that world-building would be slowed down by a thousand little knuckle-bumps,
		particularly with regard to building and managing complex content.</p>
		<p>Acorn is designed to be a better tool for the job: weaving together the best features 
		from many great languages with its own innovative conveniences.
		A lot of time was devoted to honing and polishing its simple design 
		to make 3-D world-building as easy as possible:
		easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to enrich.
		What makes Acorn distinctive is not so much its capabilities, 
		but the way it marries them together, powerfully and seamlessly.</p>
		
		<h2>Acorn is just a rich, flexible engine</h2>
		<p>Even though Acorn was designed for 3-D world-building, 
		there are no explicit three-dimensional capabilities baked into the language and its core types.
		This is because Acorn is just the glue.
		It provides only the essential programming abstractions needed to connect together the parts of a 3-D world
		(or, really, any kind of model). 
		Acorn is the engine that powers Pegasus3D, the 3D browser.</p>
		<p>Acorn binds together all aspects of a 3D scene:
		the look, location and properties of its parts, how they behave, and how people interact with them.
		Unlike the world-wide web, which requires 3<sup>+</sup> languages to render an interactive web page,
		Acorn facilitates all these capabilities within a single, concise, extensible language.</p>
		<p>To make 3-D worlds, Acorn requires three-dimensional raw materials 
		that we can clone, shape and then glue together with Acorn.
		The starter set for these raw materials is the 
		<a href="../types/world/index.html">World type</a> library.
		These types are factories for creating a world's many different types of parts,
		such as a scene, shape, texture, camera, widget or world.
		It also provides types for encoding various property values, such as an Xyz coordinate 
		or an RGBA color.</p>
		
		<h2>How does Acorn support 3D content?</h2>
		<p>Imagine that a scene in your world is like a stage setting for a play.
		Perhaps a wall divides the stage, separating a meadow from the overgrown garden. 
		A locked, metal door traps anyone within the garden who does not have its key.
		The moon casts a dim glow on two lovers sneaking towards the wall from opposite sides.</p>
		<p>For Acorn, these are all <b>Parts</b>: both lovers, the moon, the wall, the door and the key.
		Acorn invests much of its 3-D magic in the humble, but flexible Part:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Every part has a dictionary of its named <b>properties</b>, varying from part to part.
		A property's value can be as simple as 
		a symbol (<span class="pre">name: 'Bottom'</span>)
		or a number (<span class="pre">age: 36</span>).
		A property's value can be a <b>collection</b>, 
		such as a list (<span class="pre">pocket_items: +List</span>, which hopefully includes the garden key).
		<p>A property's value can also be a <b>method</b>, 
		a behavioral procedure which the part can perform on demand.
		The lover named Bottom likely has one method named 
		<span class="pre">'sneak'</span> and another called <span class="pre">'jump'</span>
		(used when caught sneaking).
		Methods are often triggered by events, such as user interactions or collisions.
		</p></li>
		<li>Parts can contain sub-parts.
		The wall, door, and moon parts are listed within the garden scene's
		<span class="pre">parts</span> property.
		The scene part, in turn, is listed in the Midsummer world's <span class="pre">scenes</span> property.
		<p>Typically, every part in a world is fully described by its Acorn <b>program</b>,
		which is a Internet resource, uniquely identified by its url address.
		Parts include or reference other parts using their url addresses.
		This simple modularity scheme would allow
		a world to license and make use of a dragon part hosted on a different domain by another company.
		</p></li>
		<li>Every part has a <b>type</b>,
		which specifies the properties and methods it shares in common with other parts of the same type.
		Thus, our scene's moon might be a Light, able to illuminate other scene parts.
		The wall is an unmoving Thing, whose shape takes up space and provides an obstacle. 
		The key is an Item which can be carried and used. 
		The lovers are Avatars, whose actions are controlled by people.
		<p>Types are like factories, used to create new parts (<b>instances</b>) of that type.
		Once created, a part's properties can be customized to ensure it looks and behaves 
		differently from other parts of that type, if desired.
		The two lovers look and behave differently, even though both are Avatars.</p>
		<p>Acorn provides a powerful starter set of <a href="../types/world/index.html">World types</a>. 
		Additionally, Acorn supports creation of new types, enriched, specialized versions of other types.
		It also supports creation of <b>mixins</b>, additional properties and methods
		accessible on a part-by-part basis.</p></li>
		<li>Property values can be synchronized between parts.
		Thus, if the name of an avatar is changed using a windowed widget, 
		the name displayed over the avatar changes accordingly.
		The same mechanism also helps ensure that when two players visit the same world,
		they are able to see the same things in the same places doing the same things.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>This Acorn Language Reference only describes the language (and, to some degree, the core type library).
		It does so using the terminology of general purpose programming.
		It rarely touches on the World type library, and only infrequently applies the language's abstract capabilities
		to the more concrete task of building 3-D worlds. 
		For readers who would prefer to learn the language within the context of its primary purpose,
		the <a href="../recipes/index.html">World-Building Recipes</a> might be more helpful.</p>
