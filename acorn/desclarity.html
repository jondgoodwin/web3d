	<p>A very important design goal for Acorn is that its code be clear, intuitive and easy to follow.
	It is not enough to make it easy for novices and professionals to create the code.
	More importantly, any resulting, well-designed code should be easy to understand when 
	picked up by the author or others months later.</p>
	<p>Several principles were employed in a balanced way to ensure Acorn code clarity:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Minimize the language's grammar and rules to a few powerful constructs.</li>
	<li>Minimize confusing or distracting punctuation delimiters.</li>
	<li>Leverage familiar terms, concepts and grammars.</li>
	<li>Take advantage of the brain's organizational preference to "chunk" information into a related, small groups
	(a key design principle that helps drive the need for modularity).</li>
	<li>Use white space to indicate how items are grouped.</li>
	<li>Make it easy to express commonly used scenarios using concise code.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These principles have been applied to Acorn's design at every level.</p>
	
	<h2>Programs as Parts</h2>
	<p>Lego bricks have a well-deserved reputation for being easy to snap together to form shapes.
	Lego accomplishes this by ensuring that all pieces conform to a simple inter-locking standard.</p>
	<p>In the same vein, Acorn defines a simple, modular mechanism for snapping together a world's various parts:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Each part is a fully defined by one Acorn program that can be referenced by its unique Internet address.
	The program defines the part using a 'this' block, whose value is implicitly returned to 
	any owning part that references it.</li>
	<li>Every part incorporates all its sub-parts by referencing their Internet addresses, using the '@' operator.
	Since the resource returns the built part as a single returned value, it can be plugged right into 
	the appropriate property for its owning part.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Thus, every 3-D world starts with a single part (program). 
	That world part incorporates its scene and widget parts by URL reference to their programs. 
	These sub-parts, in turn, incorporate their models, skins, and other parts. And so it goes...</p>
	<p>This "part-of" organizational scheme is simple, modular, and easy to create and read.<p>
	
	<h2>Reusing Properties and Methods</h2>
	<p>In a similar way, parts can plug into one or more types: 
	each a sharable collection of properties or methods that can be used by multiple parts.
	This dynamic inheritance mechanism is simple and flexible: each part can specify multiple type collections 
	whose properties and methods are then considered members of the part. 
	The part can then supplement or override these with its own methods and properties.
	Once defined, this part can then be used as a type collection (prototype) for yet another part.</p>
	<p>This "type-of" organizational scheme is also simple, modular, and easy to create and read,
	so long as the inheritance design of a world's types is kept appropriately lean and flat.</p>
	
	<h2>Modular blocks</h2>
	<p>Within programs, Acorn makes extensive use of code blocks: 
	indented code statements bound together for a single purpose.
	Using white space to highlight blocks, rather than character delimiters, makes them more concise and readable.</p>
	<p>As structured programming showed, assembling code using a small collection of simple block structures 
	with well-defined entry and exit points makes code far easier to follow than spaghetti code.
	Acorn offers ten varieties of blocks, four for conditional execution,
	two for defining methods and closures,
	and four as unique, useful wrappers around related statements of code.
	Of these wrapper blocks, the most noteworthy is the versatile 'this' block which, along with the 'this' operators, 
	enable the concise, readable assembly of both static and dynamic content.</p>
	<p>Another readability bonus is Acorn's control clauses, a concise way to combine a simple statement
	and one or more conditional logic blocks together into a single statement.</p>
	
	<h2>Expressions</h2>
	<p>Several notable dynamic languages (such as Lisp, Forth, or Smalltalk) are built around 
	distinctive, minimalist grammars. 
	Although the rules are simple and flexible, many find the resulting code difficult to understand,
	mostly due to various challenges deciphering what happens when, according to unfamiliar rules.</p>
	<p>Similar to the most widely used programming languages, Acorn's more complex expression grammar is an
	outgrowth of the familiar arithmetic expression grammar taught in school. 
	Acorn provides a small collection of prefix and infix operators mostly for arithmetic, comparison, 
	boolean logic and assignment. 
	These operators, and their evaluation precedence rules, are likely to be very familiar to most people.</p>
	<p>Acorn makes moderate use of syntactic sugar: operators and other grammatic structures 
	that can be accomplished in a another, fundamental but more verbose way.
	For example, many operators are theoretically unnecessary, as they be can performed using a method call.
	These sugared constructions help make the code more concise and easier to read, 
	outweighing any minor complexity they add to the language's grammar.</p>
