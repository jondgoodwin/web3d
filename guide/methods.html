    <div class="text">

	<p>To make our parts smart, we give them procedural instructions packaged up as methods and functions.
	Methods and functions are basically a sequence of instructions that are performed when requested. 
	There are many kinds of instructions, with expressions being the most commonly used. 
	Others will be introduced over the next two chapters.</p>
	<p>Acorn encourages a part-oriented architecture for the world's behavioral logic:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The smart logic should be sensibly distributed out to all affected parts, rather than centralized in
	some monolithic code structure.</li>
	<li>A part's "look" and "behavior" should be elegantly interwoven within the part's resource program.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These design principles make a world's design easier to understand and maintain.</p>
	
	<h2 id="method">Method Definition</h2>
	<p>In the previous chapter, we introduced how to invoke type-specific methods on values.
	Each of WOM's specialized parts for building a world (such as Scene or Entity) 
	provide pre-defined methods for accessing a part's contents or controlling its behavior.</p>
	<p>What's cool is that we can further customize a part's behavior by adding methods to it
	which give it unique motion or interaction behaviors.
	In Acorn, such methods are simply another type of keyed value that is added to a part.
	similar to adding a property to a part (though in a different Index). For example:</p>
<pre>
# Teach frosty how to 'jump'
frosty +[
	# Define a method named 'jump', which takes a single parameter 'velocity'.
	jump(velocity):>
		# Tab-indented statements are performed when the method is called
		::vel = velocity

# Later on, we can use the method
frosty.jump(5.0)
</pre>
	<p>	A method consists of its name and parameters to the left of the method definition operator 
	<span class="pre">:></span>. Its indented instruction block follows. 
	Instructions can make use of method-specific variables <span class="pre">self</span> and <span class="pre">this</span>.
	Instructions can return value(s) to the method caller.
	Let's explore each of these in greater detail.</p>
	
	<h3>Method Name</h3>
	The method name is a symbol. It is used to store the method definition (which is a type of value)
	in the part's method Index (distinct from the part's property Index) using the name as a key.</p>
	<p>The nature of the name is meaningful:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Symbols</b>. If the method name looks like a variable name, it will be properly understood as a Symbol, 
	needing no extra punctuation.</li>
	<li><b>Operators</b>. If the method name does not look like a variable name
	(e.g., including invalid punctuation), it should look like a symbol literal, enclosed within single quotes.
	This is how to define methods which provide the functionality for various operators
	(e.g., <span class="pre">'+'(val):></span> would define a method for the arithmetic add operator).
	</li>
	<li><b>Expressions</b>. If the method's name is the calculated result of an expression 
	(such as the contents of a variable), 
	it should be enclosed in parentheses (e.g., <span class="pre">(methname)(parm):></span>.</li>
	<li><b>Getters and setters</b>. Consider the expression:
<pre>
a.pos = b.pos
</pre>
	<p>The right side extracts a value from b using the getter method called <span class="pre">pos</span>.
	The left side sets that value within a using the method called <span class="pre">'pos='</span>,
	whose definition would begin: <span class="pre">'pos='(val):></span>.
	Thus, invoked method setters have the '=' automatically appended to the symbol name.</p>
	<p>The container selector operator <span class="pre">()</span> is implemented using the
	<span class="pre">'()'</span> getter method and <span class="pre">'()='</span> setter method.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>? and !</b>. By convention, if a method's name ends with '?'
	(e.g., <span class="pre">empty?</span>), it returns a true or false value.
	When the method name ends with a '!' (e.g, <span class="pre">clear!</span>), 
	it modifies the contents of the collection it is applied to.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<p>A method definition typically lists the names for parameters passed to the method when invoked.
	These names may be enclosed in parentheses and are separated by commas. 
	The names are used in the method's instructions to retrieve the passed values:</p>
<pre>
o = Part[
	adder(a,b):>
		a+b

o.adder(3,4)	 # returns 7
o.adder("a","b") # returns "ab"
</pre>
	<p>If a passed value is a collection or compound value, its content can be changed when passed to a method.
	Numbers and other immediate values may change within a method, but are unchanged where they are passed.</p>
<pre>
o = Part[
	changer(a,b):>
		a=3       # within the method, a is now 3
		b.clear!  # empty b's collection

x=5
y="abc"
o.changer(x,y)  # will change the y collection, but cannot change a number
m,n = x,y     # m is 5, but n is ""
</pre>
	<p>The number of parameters passed can be different than the number defined.
	Any excess are ignored. Missing parameters are assigned to null.</p>
	<p>To capture a variable number of parameters, use the ellipsis before a final parameter name.
	The excess parameters will be turned into a Tuple and passed into that parameter name.
<pre>
o = Part[
	printer(dev..parms):>
		dev.print(parms)

o.printer(console, "number is", 3)
</pre>

	<h3>Local variables</h3>
	<p>Local variables (starting with a lower case letter) were introduced in the previous chapter.
	Now we can clarify that local variables are local to the method they appear in.
	Each use of a method has its own collection of values attached to its local variables. 
	When a method is invoked, all local variables have a value of null.
	When the method is finished, its local variable values cease to exist.</p>
	<p>The method's parameters are in effect also local variables. However, their initial value 
	is the values actually passed to the method when it is called.</p>
	
	<h3>self</h3>
	<p>In addition to the named parameters, there is also an assumed parameter named "self".
	The value of self is basically the value that the method was applied to.</p>
<pre>
slow(factor):>
	noise = Float.rand  # noise is a local variable
	factor *= noise     # parameter value can be altered
	self.vel *= factor  # change self's velocity
</pre>
	
	<h3>This variable and block</h3>
	<p>Sometimes there is one variable in a method that is getting most of the attention.
	Acorn knows this variable as "this", and allows it to be omitted from expressions before member look-ups
	or method calls.</p>
	<p>At the start of a method, this is assigned to self. However, it can be changed easily using a "this"
	block. An expression instruction establishes the value of "this", which can then be used implicitly
	by all tab-indented statements in the following block. 
	This accomplishes something similar to jQuery's chaining, but in a more flexible way.</p>
<pre>
sample:>
	v = .v  # local variable v assigned to self.x
	.k      # resets 'this' to self.k
		.vel += Xyz[1,0,0]  # .vel refers to self.k.vel
		.move v
	.v += 1 # this is back to self again
</pre>
	
	<h3>Return value</h3>
	<p>A method is called as part of an expression. 
	When the method's code is done executing and ready to restore execution back to the 
	calling expression, it returns back one or more values.</p>
	<p>By default, the method returns the value of the last instruction's expression. 
	However, a "return" instruction can be placed anywhere within a method's code that 
	accomplishing the same this, returning control to the calling expression, passing 
	back the value of any expression that follows the return instruction. 
	</p>
<pre>
sq:>
	self*self   # same as return self*self

dist:>
	return (self.x.sq + self.y.sq + self.z.sq).sqrt
	self.sq     $ ignored, since we have already returned
	
Xyz[3,4,0].dist  # Calculates as 5.0
</pre>	


	<h2 id="function">Function Definition</h2>
	<p>Functions are very much like methods:
	they have parameters, local variables, and an instruction block. 
	They also return values:</p>
<pre>
sq = (x)->   # -> is the operator for defining a function
	x*x
</pre>
	<p>Notice that a function definition is a value (of type Function),
	which means we can store it in a variable.
	The sq variable can then be used to call the function, passing comma-separated parameters:</p>
<pre>
sq(4)  # calls the function stored in sq, passing 4 for x. Returns 16
</pre>
	<p>Notice that the grammar for a function call looks just like a selector for a collection. 
	Acorn sees them as a conceptually similar way to do functional mapping.</p>
	<p><b>Note</b>: Empty parentheses are required when a function call has no parameters to pass. 
	When parameters and parentheses are both missing, the value returned is the function itself.
	</p>

	<h3>Function vs. Method</h3>
	<p>Pretty much everything described earlier for methods apply to functions, 
	other than these key differences:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The function definition operator is <span class="pre">-></span> 
	(rather than <span class="pre">:></span> for a method).</li>
	<li>Function definitions are not named (anonymous), making them easier to
	assign to variables or pass around for later use.</li>
	<li>Functions do not have an implicit parameter called <span class="pre">self</span>,
	as they are not attached or applied to a value, as a method is.
	As self does not exist, <span class="pre">this</span> is undefined outside a this block.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In most cases, reusable instructions should be packaged as a method, when the 
	instructions focus on a value of a particular type. 
	However, functions have a prominent role in several scenarios:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Collection iterator methods</b> (e.g., <span class="pre">.each</span>) accept
	a function value as a parameter, enabling local specialization of the iterator logic.
	See <a href="flow.html#iterator">collection iterators</a> for more details.</li>
	<li><b>Generic type functions</b> can be created where the function does not require
	a specific self value, but is still heavily associated with a specific type. 
	A good example of this is: Float::rand.</li>
	<li><b>Acorn Programs</b>. Every Acorn program is implicitly a function
	whose implied parameter is <span class="pre">(..args)</span> and whose return value
	is always converted to a Part, if not one already.
	Typically, program functions are run just once when loaded and then discarded,
	leaving behind their returned value and any changes made to global variables.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Local Variable Sharing</h3>
	<p>Functions are often defined within methods or other functions.
	Despite looking like one piece of code, there is no sharing of local variables 
	between the inner function and the outer function or method it is declared within.
	To share values, they must be passed as parameters or returned as values.</p>
	<p>Put another way, Acorn functions are not closures.</p>
	
	<h2 id="type">Type Definition</h2>
	<p>In this chapter, we have explained how to define a method or a function, 
	either of which can be added to a part to define its behavior and give it interactive "smarts".
	What if we wanted to create a collection or library of methods and/or functions 
	that we could apply across multiple parts. 
	For example, we might want to define a swinging open and close behavior for doors,
	a generic walk and run behavior for all legged animals, etc.</p>
	<p>That is what a Type really is: a Part that contains a reusable library of methods and/or functions 
	that automatically apply to all values that have subscribed to it.
	As always, the builder is used to define a new Type:</p>
<pre>
# Define a new Type called Animal
Animal = Type[
	Part     # Animals get all Part methods
	
	# Define a Animal method called 'speak'	
	speak(word):>
		$.play ::vocab(word)  # Look up the word in the animal's vocabulary, then play it
</pre>
	<p>Once a new type has been defined, the builder can be used to create a new part
	based on that type:</p>
<pre>
# Create a new Animal using the brand-new type just defined		
fred = Animal[
	vocab: Index[hello: "I hate you"]

# Ask fred to say 'hello' in his vocabulary
fred.speak('hello')	# plays "I hate you"
</pre>
	<p>Every animal value we create using the new Animal type will use the same method. 
	However, since each animal has a different
	vocabulary, they will each say hello in all sorts of colorfully different ways.</p>
	
	<h3>Multiple Inheritance and Mixins</h3>
	<p>When we defined Animal above, we started with a line <span class="pre">Part</span>,
	which refers to the Acorn's Part type. 
	Listing types within a new type is how one includes, by reference,
	additional libraries of methods within a new library of methods.</p>
	<p>The same technique can be used to add libraries of methods to a single part:</p>
<pre>
frosty +[
	MoonBayFever   # Makes the MoonBayFever type's methods accessible to frosty, poor dear
</pre>
	<p>In effect, all Types and Parts keep a List of types whose methods they have access to.
	Any changes to the methods for a type are automatically seen by all types or parts
	subscribed to its methods.</p>
	
	<h3>Method Search</h3>
	<p>Given all the interconnected method libraries used by values,
	how does Acorn select which method to use against a value?</p>
	<ol>
	<li>If the value is a Part (but not a Type), it will first look up the method symbol
	in the part's own method library. Even though a Type is a Part, we won't do this for a Type
	because a Type's methods are intended for use by the values it makes, and not for the Type itself.
	<p>Failing that, Acorn searches each of the part's added type libraries one-by-one, in the order
	they were added to the part. Each of these type libraries may point to other type libraries 
	to search through.</p></li>
	<li>For non-Parts, Acorn looks for the method in the value's type, 
	then recursively through any type libraries it references, 
	going all the way back ultimately to the universal type All.</li>
	<li>Failing that, Acorn call the "._mnf" method-not-found method, starting the search
	all over again (TBD). Failing everything, the null value is returned.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If for performance or other reasons, you wish to avoid this search,
	do a method call by passing the method itself, rather than the method's Symbol name:</p>
<pre>
frosty.MoonBayFever::bayAtMoon
</pre>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Now that you can add methods, functions, and type libraries to any part
	in your 3-D world, how will you make your static world come alive with interesting, complex behaviors?</p>
	<p>What else do you need to improve it further?  How about the ability to evaluate the state of the world
	and change behavior accordingly...</p>
