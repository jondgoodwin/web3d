	<h1>Part Magic</h1>
	<p>Already talked about:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>What a part is in "scene.html"</li>
	<li>Accessing properties & members of a part, in expressions</li>
	<li>Adding methods and types to a part in methods</li>
	<li>Parts as resources ...</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now we need to talk about 2-way binding, part selection via matchers, ...</p>
	
	<p><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  OLD STUFF >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>></p>
		<p>Nearly every element in a 3-D scene is (deep down inside) a Part, 
		simply because such elements are pieces within a larger hierarchical structure (the scene). 
		In addition to the hierarchical structure, each Part offers up the following information about itself:
		<ul>
		<li>Attributes, as a Dict, including its name and parent.</li>
		<li>Sub-parts, as an ordered List.</li>
		<li>Unique methods which can act on the part, beyond those provided by its type</li>
		<li>Mixin types??, offering additional methods which can act on the part</li>
		</ul>
<pre>
sun = Lightbulb[
	name: 'Sun'
	parent: $
	pos: Xyz[0,0,0]
	color: Rgba[1,1,1]
	on:> 
		#turn it on
</pre>

		<h2>Attributes</h2>
		<p>Access to (.attr), changing</p>
		<p>Special attributes: parent, name, </p>
		
		<h2>Subparts</h2>
		<p>each</p>
		
		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>defining, using</p>
		<p>self goes to attr&subparts, type vars</p>
		
		<h2>Mixins</h2>
		<p>Keep here??? super</p>
		
		<h2 id="sel">Part selection patterns</h3>
		<p>'/' operator for splitting?  '%' for selecting?</p>
		<p>Any part can be queried for a part within it. .select() returns List of all that match the pattern.
		A special pre-parsed Sel"...." pattern: An element can be</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Type (the major type, or one contained within?)</li>
		<li>id (a symbol)</li>
		<li>method invocation plus parameters. Very powerful for adding all sorts of unusual matches
		(all with non-zero velocity, those with severe aggro, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These can be combined with others with logical operators, and parentheses</p>
		<p>They can be within statement sequences, separated by ;. A separator of .. is allowed to match spaced matches></p>
		<p>They can be within parent sequences, separated by '/'. A separator of .. is allowed here as well.</p>
