		<h2>Values and Types</h3>
		<p>All data values in Acorn are typed.
		For example, <span class="pre">1</span> is an Integer, <span class="pre">4.5</span> is a Float, 
		and <span class="pre">"Hello"</span> is Text.</p>
		<p>A value's type may be either one of Acorn's <a href="types/index.html">built-in types</a>
		(described in subsequent chapters) or a new type defined using
		<a href="types.html">Acorn</a> or <a href="extension.html">C</a> code.
		Values with code-defined types are manipulated using the same Acorn features as built-in types.
		
		<h2>Variables</h2>
		<p>A variable is a named identifier which holds a single value of any type.
		Thus, the variable <span class="pre">color</span> could be given the Text value "red", 
		then later be changed to the value "green".</p>
		<p>A variable name starts with a letter, underscore or dollar sign.
		The rest of the variable name can include numbers as well as letters, underscores, and dollar signs.
		<span class="pre">a21</span>, <span class="pre">first</span>, <span class="pre">First</span>, 
		<span class="pre">_private_var</span>, <span class="pre">camelCase</span> and <span class="pre">$</span>
		are all valid variable names.</p>
		<p>Any variable name that starts with an uppercase letter or dollar sign is a <b>global</b> variable. 
		A global variable's value can be viewed or changed by any program.
		By convention, global variables starting with an uppercase letter are Acorn types
		(for example, <a href="types/index.html">Acorn's built-in types</a>).
		The global variables starting with $ are for other global data, 
		including <a href="env.html">environment values</a> provided by Acorn, such as
		<span class="pre">$</span> (the current scene) 
		and <span class="pre">$$</span> (the current environment).</p>
		<p>If a variable name starts with a lowercase letter or underscore, it is a <b>local</b> variable.
		A local variable's value can only be viewed and changed by the function where its value has been set. 
		Any other function that uses the same variable name will have its own distinct value.</p>
		<p>Unless a variable needs to be accessed by many functions, 
		it is better to make the variable local, as it improves performance and 
		reduces the likelihood of code problems.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Acorn <a href="reftoken.html#reserved">reserves several identifiers</a> for special purposes. 
		These cannot be used as variable names.</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>A value's type establishes both its possible values and the ways that value can be manipulated.
		Each specific way that a value can be manipulated is called a method.
		Each method uses the original value to calculate (in a very specific manner)
		a new value (of any type) which is returned by the method.</p>
		<p>Method names typically look like variable names, but do not act like them. 
		Acorn can tell the difference between them, as methods are preceded by 
		a value and a period. To specify a method name that would not be permissible as
		a variable name (e.g., one that uses unusual punctuation characters), put single quotes around it.</p>
		<p>The methods that can be applied to a value are established by that value's type
		(and are therefore listed and described in the descriptive information about each 
		<a href="types/index.html">type</a>).
		Different types can have identically-named methods that do similar, but technically 
		different things.
		For example, the size method can be applied to any Text value,
		returning back a count of its characters. Thus, 'abc'.size returns the Integer value of 3.
		The size method on a list counts the number of its elements.</p>
		<p>Here are some other examples (the '#' indicates that what follows is a comment which
		describes what the line of code accomplishes):</p>
<pre>
2.0.sqrt               # returns the square root of 2: 1.4142135
'abc'.reverse          # returns the value 'cba'
'The End'.split(' ')   # returns a List ['The', 'End']
</pre>
		<p>In the last example, notice that additional information was provided to the split
		method in parentheses (which are optional in most cases). When 
		providing multiple parameters to a method, separate them with commas.</p>
		<p>Methods can be chained together in arbitrarily long sequences,
		and are performed in left-to-right order:</p>
<pre>
'abc'.reverse.size     # returns 3
</pre>
		
		<h2>Type Conversion</h2>
		<p>In general, Acorn does not automatically convert values from one type to another.
		However, some methods may automatically perform type conversions in certain situations.</p>
		<p>If type conversion is explicitly desired, the typical way to do that 
		(where supported by the originating type) is to use a 
		method whose name is the same as the desired type.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
2.0.Integer  # converts the floating point number 2.0 to the integer 2
"2.34".Float # returns the floating point number 2.34
</pre>

		<h2>Operators</h2>
		<p>Acorn provides a more convenient way to invoke certain common methods
		using punctuation-based operators. Many of these operators look
		(and, for numbers, act) like operators used in arithmetic expressions (such as '+', '-', '*' and '/').
		Using these operators makes code more concise and easier to read 
		than using the equivalent method (compare <i>x+1</i> to <i>x.'+' 1</i>).</p>
		<p>There are several flavors of operators. 
		<b>Binary</b> operators, which require two values, are the most common.
		As shown above, a binary operator is placed between the two values being operated on.
		Under the covers, Acorn uses the method with the same name as the operator.</p>
		<p>It is important to realize that the left-hand value determines
		which method's operation is performed on both values.
		Thus, <i>2.0+4.1</i> yields a different result than <i>2+4.1</i>, as 
		the first uses the floating point '+' method (giving a result of <i>6.1</i>),
		while the second uses the Integer '+' method, resulting in the Integer value of <i>6</i>.</p>
		<p>In this example, the '+' operator invokes a character-oriented method for '+',
		performing a different kind of calculation:</p>
<pre>
'ab'+'cd' # concatenates them to return 'abcd'
</pre>
		<p><b>Unary</b> operators are another flavor, operating on just one value.
		Unary operators are placed before the value. 
		With the exception of the '-' unary operator, they invoke a method of the same name.
		The '-' unary operator invokes the '@-' method, to distinguish it from the '-' binary method.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> To make sure that Acorn correctly distinguishes a prefix operator such as as the negative <b>-</b> prefix
		operator from the minus <b>-</b>, be sure the prefix operator has white space before it,
		but not between it and its value.</p>
<pre>
-2*5 # returns -10
</pre>
		<p>More information about these operators and what they do 
		can be found in the type-specific chapters that follow.</p>

		<h2>Expressions</h2>
		<p>The features explained so far (values, variables, methods and operators)
		can be assembled together to form simple or complex expressions.
		These precedence rules are used to determine the order of evaluating 
		the expression's operations:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Operations within parentheses are evaluated before those outside</li>
		
		<li>Operations are performed in left-to-right order.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Operator precedence and left-to-right arrangements dictate the order in which operations 
		are performed. The precedence rules are similar to those of arithmetic expressions (e.g., exponents
		before multiply and divide before addition and subtraction), but more involved due to the 
		greater number of available operators.
<pre>
2+3*4**2 # returns 50
</pre>
		<p>In most cases, an expression yields a single value, though it can yield multiple values.</p>
		
		<p><b>White Space</b>
		Except for line indentation and within Text literals, multiple spaces and tabs are treated the same as a single space,
		and used to separate any token from the next.</p>
		</ul>
		

		
		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>All operators that end with "=" are assignment operators. 
		They are used to change a variable's value.</p>
		<p>To the right of the operator is an expression whose resulting value will be used to change the variable.
		The left indicates the variable(s) (or part of them) to be altered.
		The assignment is itself an expression, whose value is the new value of the variable.</p>
		<p>A straight assignment (using <b>=</b>) just sets a new value.
		The other assignment operators operate in two steps, performing the appropriate binary operation
		and then doing a straight assignment.</p>
<pre>
area = 3.141592*r*r # area of a circle
counter += 1 # Adds 1 to counter, then assigns that to counter
mighty += (expvalu *= 2) # mighty incremented by new value of expvalu
</pre>
		<p>Assignment expressions can also have multiple values before or after the assignment operator.
		All values on the right are evaluated before performing the assignment to the variables on the left.</p>
<pre>
a,b = b,a # swaps the values of a and b
a,b = 3 # a is 3, b is null
c = a,b # changes c. b is evaluated but not assigned to anything
</pre>
		
				
		<p>Assignments are part of expressions, and can be embedded deeply in any expression. For straight assignments, 
		they return whatever values are on the right side of the expression regardless of the left hand terms.</p>
		
		<p>Although the right hand consists of an expression that evaluates to one or more values, the left hand side
		is more restrictive on the terms (no literals) that may be used which are treated differently 
		than if found on the right hand side:
		
		<ul>
		<li>A local or global <a href="variable.html">variable</a>. 
		Its stored value is changed to the evaluated value on the right side.
<pre>
pi = 3.14159
Mixup = p,q -> {Flu(p) = q; Flu(q) = p}
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>A <b>call/get.</b> A term followed by a list of parameters. When on the left hand side,
		this store the right side value into the indexed element (using the .put method, if needed).
		In effect, the right hand side value(s) is appended to the left side parameters.
		<p>The part syntax, using ::, can also be employed to similar effect.</p>
<pre>
"abc"(2) = "x" # "axc"
(p,q->{return Storage(p) = q}) 3 = 'a' # Storage(3) is now 'a'
[:a: 1, :c: 3]::b = 2 # [:a: 1, :b: 2, :c: 3]
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>A <b>method call.</b> A term followed by a period, a member name, and optional parameters.
		This will search for a method symbol that has an appended '=' (thus: a.b = c looks for a type method
		for a called "b=". If a function, it is called passing the parameters with the value as an added parameter.
		If it is a property, the properties value is updated with the right side value.
		</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Multiple value assignments</h3>
		<p>Can have lists on left and right, improves conciseness and enables swapping of values.</p>
		<p>TBD on the rules when the nbr in lists disagree</p>
		
		<h3>Calculating Assignments</h3>
		<p>+=, etc. TBD.</p>

		<p>Line formatting is used to make programs more compact and readable. 
		Rather than require end-of-statement semi-colons (';') and block braces	('{}'), 
		Acorn uses intuitive line formatting rules to delineate statements and blocks.
